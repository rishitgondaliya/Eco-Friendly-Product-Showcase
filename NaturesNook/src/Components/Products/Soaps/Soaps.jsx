          <h1 className="text-xl text-gray-700 font-medium">Are your natural soap bars cruelty-free?</h1>
          <br />
          <p>Yes. All of our soap bars are cruelty-free and vegan, meaning that we do not test on animals or use animal-derived ingredients. We handcraft all our bars with the utmost care, using only sustainable and organic materials.</p>
          <br />
          <h1 className="text-xl text-gray-700 font-medium">How are natural soap bars different from regular soap bars?</h1>
          <br />
          <p>
            Natural soap bars are made with natural and organic ingredients, whereas regular soap bars often contain chemicals and synthetic additives. <br />
            You can rest assured that our natural soap bars are free from parabens, sulphates and harsh detergents that can be found in some commercial soaps, ensuring a gentle touch on your skin.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h1 className="text-xl text-gray-700 font-medium">How long does each bar last?</h1>
          <br />
          <p>The longevity of each soap bar depends on usage, but typically each soap bar will last 2-3 weeks.</p>
          <br />
          <h1 className="text-xl text-gray-700 font-medium">How should I store my soap bars to make them last longer?</h1>

            <ul>
              <li>1. Store them in a cool, dry place.</li>
              <li>2. Keep them away from direct sunlight and excessive humidity.</li>
              <li>3. Use a soap dish with proper drainage to prevent them from getting soggy.</li>
