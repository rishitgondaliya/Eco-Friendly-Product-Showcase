          <p>Natural bathroom products are an essential way to reduce waste in your home. Traditionally, bathrooms, toilets and restrooms are littered with plastics and microplastics that disguise themselves in shower gels, soaps, razors and more! If you’re aiming to switch to a zero waste lifestyle, make a few quick and easy changes to sustainable bathroom products. It’s the best place to start!</p>
          <br />
          <p>Nature&apos;s nook’s range of eco-friendly toiletries are all designed to help you kick plastic out of your home (and save money doing it). Our eco bathroom products last much longer than supermarket alternatives and in some cases are infinitely reusable! All of our cosmetic products are certified micro plastic-free, vegan, chemical-free and palm-oil free. With the exception of sodium hydroxide (a key soap component), our cosmetics are all made using 100% organic ingredients as well!</p>
          <br />
          <p>Many of our eco bathroom alternatives are made using environmentally friendly plastic substitutes such as bamboo or natural loofahs whilst the bases of our soaps are made with reclaimed coconut oil, sustainably sourced in Southern Vietnam.</p>
