                    <p>Simply click through to the product page and choose the quantity of straws that you need. Once you’ve decided the amount of custom straws that you need, type in your desired text and font and we’ll do the rest.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>If you’d like a logo engraved on your straws, upload it via the product page and our design team will make a prototype within 2 days for your approval. If you want to change the design, you can do so as many times as you’d like or you can cancel the order at any time without being charged.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Our job is to ensure that every single customer loves their personalised straws. If you’re not happy, then we’re not happy!</p>

                <p className="text-xl text-gray-600">
                    <p>Personalised drinking straws look best when the design is short and bold. If you are buying custom straws for a business or branded straws for an event, then try using your website, a hashtag or simply the brand name.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>If you’re ordering personalised wedding straws or custom straws as wedding favours then the bride & grooms’ names, separated by a heart or another simple line art design looks great. You can also include the date on each straw as a keepsake.</p>
