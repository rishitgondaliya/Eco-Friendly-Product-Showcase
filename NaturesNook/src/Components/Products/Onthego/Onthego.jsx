                    <p>Zero waste travel products ensure that whether you’re camping, backpacking or travelling abroad, your trip is guilt-free (and plastic-free)! We have created a range of sustainable, eco-friendly on the go products that not only replace single-use plastic, but often help small communities in Vietnam thrive! Many of our zero waste on-the-go products are handmade in rural Vietnam. Whether it’s our signature Jungle Straws or our travel cutlery sets, all of our products are made with purpose!</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Our travel-friendly range of ethical and reusable plastic alternatives can be used whilst at work, on planes, with street food or at camp! Everything we sell is vegan-friendly too, so all of our on-the-go vegan products make the perfect plant-based gifts!</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>If you’re out and about, start using environmentally friendly products instead of creating more waste. Nature&apos;s nook produces the best eco on-the-go products and they are all available on our online store.</p>
