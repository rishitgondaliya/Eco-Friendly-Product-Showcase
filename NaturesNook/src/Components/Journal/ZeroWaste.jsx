        Ultimate Guide to Plastic-Free Washing Up
      </h1>
      <p className="leading-8">
        Washing up is a dreaded household chore, there’s no question about it.
        And for generations we as a society have thought that the damage caused
        by washing up was limited to a bit of boredom after dinner! <br />
        But that’s where we were wrong… <br />
        Washing up is actually incredibly wasteful. Washing up uses a lot of
        water and the washing up utensils and liquid that you use whilst washing
        up contains a whole host of chemicals, plastics and non-recyclable
        materials. <br />
        But here’s the thing. <br />
        We all need clean bowls and plates… There’s no way around it, so what’s
        the answer? Does a dishwasher use more water? How can I wash up
        sustainably without a dishwasher? How much water does washing up waste?{" "}

        How much water do I waste washing up?
      </h1>
      <p className="leading-8">
        Before we get into the nitty-gritty of whether you should use a
        dishwasher, hand wash and everything else in between, it may be useful
        to actually know how much water you waste right? <br />
        Well, estimates range from 115 gallons/per day to 1,800 gallons/per day
        when you consider the water used to grow the food that you eat and make
        the clothes that you buy. <br />
        Shocking, right? <br />
        If you want to know how much water your family wastes. There’s a free
        website that calculates it for you based on a series of questions. It’s
        mainly used by US citizens, so the projections may be a little bit off
        for Europeans and people elsewhere, but you can at least get an
        estimate. You can find the water calculator here. <br />
        Anyone who actually completes the water calculator will notice a few
        striking issues. The first is that eating meat drives up the amount of
        water you use substantially. The second is that owning a pet does the
        exact same! <br />
        Does this mean we should all quit meat and get rid of our cats and dogs?{" "}
        <br />
        Well, that’s up to you. There’s definitely a lot of ways to reduce your
        water waste by changing your diet and shopping habits, but that’s an
        article for another day! <br />

        How much water does a dishwasher use?
      </h1>
      <p className="leading-8">
        Let’s cut to the chase. <br />
        If you’re reading this and you happen to run a family household with 4
        or more people, then a dishwasher is likely much more water efficient
        than hand washing for you. (And probably more time efficient too). It's
        also perfect if you're planning a sustainable party. <br />
        Over the course of the last 20 years, dishwashers have become much more
        energy efficient and they have gradually become more water efficient
        too. <br />
        When buying a dishwasher, it’s also very easy to assess the energy usage
        levels as it’s now required by law in most countries to provide the
        consumer with this information. <br />
        It’s been said that hand washing your dishes can use up to 20 gallons of
        water! How much water does a dishwasher use? A typical energy efficient
        dishwasher uses around 4 gallons per load. <br />
        Over time, that’s a huge difference! <br />
        Some key things to remember when using a dishwasher are that it doesn’t
        just use water. Dishwashers use electricity too, so just remember to
        only turn on your dishwasher when it’s fully loaded so that you're
        getting the most bang for your buck! (And saving the most water too).{" "}
        <br />
        Another big thing to remember when operating a dishwasher is that you
        need to clean it regularly and check for any clogs caused by food waste!
        Doing this helps your dishwasher to run efficiently and effectively and
        reduces the amount of water that you use! <br />
        Here is a great article that gives a rundown on how to maintain your
        dishwasher. <br />
        For those of you that are more visual. Here’s a Youtube video. <br />
        If you want an energy efficient, reliable dishwasher right now, but you
        don’t want to do the research. Lucky you! Jungle Culture has already
        researched the most energy efficient dishwasher in the UK for you and
        you can find it right here. <br />
        Note that this dishwasher is the most energy efficient at what we feel
        is an affordable price with a good track record of reliability! <br />

        Where to find eco-friendly dishwasher tablets?
      </h1>
      <p className="leading-8">
        To run a dishwasher you need tablets which help wash old food stains off
        of your beloved plates and bowls. But many traditional dishwasher
        tablets are made using chemicals, contain microplastics and are wrapped
        in plastic! <br />
        This article answers 16 common questions about dishwasher tablets and
        explains why they are not environmentally-friendly! <br />
        Luckily, there are an abundance of companies that are making natural
        dishwasher tablets that really work! Just one example is Homethings, who
        are making dishwasher tablets that are not only eco-friendly, but they
        actually work too! <br />

        Is washing up by hand eco-friendly?
      </h1>
      <p className="leading-8">
        As we’ve already established, washing up by hand generally uses more
        water than an energy efficient dishwasher. However, using a dishwasher
        is more water efficient than washing up by hand, but that doesn’t mean
        it’s right for everybody! <br />
      </p>
      <h1 className="font-semibold text-lg sm:text-2xl">
        When is a dishwasher not the most water efficient option?
      </h1>
      <p className="leading-8">
        If you don’t have enough dishes to fully load your dishwasher. I.e. if
        you’re a single person and just have a few basic pieces of tableware.{" "}
        <br />
        If you can’t fully load the dishwasher. Sometimes you might just be
        having a quick bite before a trip and you don’t want a few plates to
        fester… It may be easier to wash them by hand! <br />
        If what you’re washing is not dishwasher safe. Dishwashers use
        incredible amounts of heat that usually mean wooden products and
        expensive glassware should be hand washed only. Our coconut husk bowls
        and bamboo bowls are both hand washed only, although our bamboo straws
        and reusable utensil sets can be put in the dishwasher (although over
        time it will degrade them). <br />
        If you just don’t have space! Lots of homes aren’t big enough to fit a
        fridge, freezer, washing machine and a dishwasher! <br />
        If you’re washing pots and pans that are too big for the dishwasher.
        Dishwashers aren’t gigantic machines, they’re made to be compact and
        some large cooking tools such as woks and baking trays just won’t fit in
        a standard sized dishwasher! <br />
        If you’re washing something that is so dirty it needs to soak. Grease
        can bake on over time and the best way to get rid of it is a good ol’
        fashioned soak. That’s something that dishwashers can’t do. <br />

        How to wash up eco-friendly
      </h1>
      <p className="leading-8">
        So, we’ve established that in certain situations it is necessary to hand
        wash our tableware. It may waste a bit more water, but follow the
        guidelines below and you can reduce the environmental impact created
        when scrubbing your dirty dishes! <br />
        The three biggest causes of waste when washing up are: <br />
        - Water waste <br />
        - Chemical waste (from washing up liquids) <br />
        - Plastic waste (from sponges, plastic dish brushes etc.) <br />
        So, let’s tackle them one-by-one:

        How to reduce water waste when washing up:
      </h1>
      <p className="leading-8">
        Our biggest water-saving tip is to use a washing up bowl or tub. Don’t
        wash your dishes under running water as this can be incredibly wasteful.{" "}
        <br />
        Instead, fill up a tub with hot water and dish soap and wash your plates
        using the water inside. <br />
        If you have a two part sink then use the second part of the sink to
        rinse dishes with cold water. <br />
