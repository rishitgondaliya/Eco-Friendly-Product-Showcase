      <h1 className="font-semibold text-lg sm:text-2xl">Can you shave your pubic hair with a safety razor?</h1>
      <p className="leading-8">
        Despite the safety razor being invented well over 100 years ago, our
        customers still often ask us whether you can shave “everywhere” with a
        safety razor. <br />
        In fact, one of the most common pre-purchase questions we receive is
        “Can you shave your pubic hair with a safety razor?” <br />
        And it`s not just women who want to know, manscaping has long been
        commonplace, across the spectrum of gender everybody wants to understand
        if you can use a safety razor to shave the hair on your body and not
        just on your face. <br />
        The answer… is interesting, and may surprise you. <br />
        Let`s start with addressing whether men can shave their pubic hair with
        a safety razor. If you`re a woman, feel free to skip ahead.
      </p>
      <h1 className="font-semibold text-lg sm:text-2xl">Can you manscape with a safety razor?</h1>
      <p className="leading-8">
        Whether you can manscape with a safety razor depends on what “style”
        you`re going for. Are you a clean shaven type of guy, or are you trying
        to achieve a subtle stubble?
        <br />
        If you`re trying to trim your pubic hair and not completely shave it
        off, then we`d recommend using an electric razor. <br />
        This razor from Braun is especially good. It`s pricey at £199.99 but it
        comes with a 5 year warranty and in our experience, it works really well
        when compared to other electric razors. <br />
        If you`re interested in a clean shave, then a reusable metal safety
        razor is definitely your best option. <br />
        Starting at just £18.99, safety razors are infinitely reusable,
        plastic-free and replacement blades are just £3.99 for 10 (or less with
        a subscription). <br />
        Now… Let`s address the elephant in the room… or should we say, let`s
        address the elephant`s trunk! <br />
        Is it safe to shave your genitals with a safety razor? The answer is
        yes, and here`s how… <br />

      <h1 className="font-semibold text-lg sm:text-2xl">How to shave your genitals with a safety razor - Men</h1>
      <p className="leading-8">
        Firstly, we always recommend shaving in the shower. The warm water and
        steam helps to open your pores, allowing you to get a closer and more
        comfortable shave. <br />
        Once you`re in the shower, start by equipping a fresh double edged
        safety razor blade and apply the best natural shaving soapto the area
        that you`d like to shave. <br />
        Now, simply shave like you would with a disposable plastic razor. Try to
        pull the skin taut to make sure you get the closest possible shave, and
        for added safety. <br />
        If you`re new to the world of manscaping, don`t rush, go slow and be
        careful. Use your razor at a 45 degree angle andonly shave in straight
        lines. <br />
        The skin around your pubic region can often be quite tender and needs
        extra protection to ensure that you don`t end up with shaving rashes and
        ingrown hairs. That is why we always recommend using aftercare products
        to moisturise and rejuvenate skin that has been through an effective
        “trauma”. <br />
        Tea tree oil based products like this Australian bodycare gel are very
        good for after shaving or this set from Bart`s is great too. <br />
        If you do not have any post-shave products at home, you can use a
        standard moisturiser or an aloe vera gel will do the trick!.

      <h1 className="font-semibold text-lg sm:text-2xl">How to shave your genitals with a safety razor - women</h1>
      <p className="leading-8">
        Shaving for women and men is broadly a similar experience. But to recap,
        we advise: <br />
        - Always shaving in the bath or shower as the steam helps to open your
        pores, giving you a cleaner and smoother shave. <br />
        - Always using plenty of natural shaving soap. Even if you`re purchasing
        shaving soap from another brand, we always recommend going chemical-free.
        The skin around your genitals is especially sensitive and chemicals can
        cause shaving rashes and bumps. <br />
        Psst…(We`ve also written this dedicated article to help you avoid shaving
        rashes) <br />
        - Always using a fresh double edged safety razor blade. Sharp blades
        create less friction which helps to lessen, reduce and avoid shaving burn
        and rashes. <br />
        Keeping these tips in mind will help you shave cleanly and effortlessly.{" "}
        <br />
        Now, when shaving “down there”, be sure to take it slow, shave in straight
        lines, bend your razor at a 45 degree angle and pull your skin taut when
        shaving. <br />
        Other than that, using a safety razor to shave your pubic hair is a very
        similar experience to using a disposable razor. <br />

        is shaving or waxing more sustainable <br />
        Shaving vs. Waxing - Which is more eco-friendly? <br />
        There is much debate over the “most” sustainable form of hair removal.
        Shaving can use more water, but if you`re going to take a bath anyway,
        then the additional water use might be negligible. <br />
        Waxing usually means using more plastic and synthetics, but no water.{" "}
        <br />

      <h1 className="font-semibold text-lg sm:text-2xl">Conclusion</h1>
      <p className="leading-8">
        To round things up, yes, both men and women can use a safety razor to
        shave their pubic region, but sadly not to trim! <br />
        Be careful, go slow, straight strokes, tilt your razor at a 45 degree
        angle and use the pre-shave and post-shave products that we recommend
        above and you`ll be just fine. <br />
        If you have any other questions about using a safety razor or shaving in
        general, leave us a comment and we`ll get back to you as soon as we can!
