      <p className="leading-8">Have you been hearing great things about safety razors but feel intimidated by them? Women's safety razors have gained popularity in recent years as a great way to reduce waste and save money doing it!

        You’re not alone. Ever since we launched our unisex safety razors, we’ve been inundated with queries from prospective customers who are curious, eager, yet daunted by making the switch. More often than not, those concerns relate to women who are looking at more sustainable alternatives to disposable razors.

        That’s why we’ve decided to bust some of the common myths out there and give you peace of mind about this zero-waste swap. Here are 7 reasons not to fear your safety razor!</p>

      <h1>What is a safety razor?</h1>
      A safety razor is also known as a double-edged razor blade. They were dubbed as ‘safety’ razors as they were considered to be safer in comparison with the straight edge razors used by professional barbers. The very first reusable safety razors were introduced as a means for men to shave at home, without having to rely on a costly trip to the barbershop. They provided a protective guard to guide the angle of the blade and shield the skin.

      Nowadays, safety razors are gaining popularity with women as much as men, for a bounty of reasons. They offer a much closer shave, cause less skin irritation, and are significantly kinder to the environment. They can even shave a few pennies off your grooming budget!

      <h1 className="font-semibold text-lg sm:text-2xl">Why you shouldn’t be scared of your safety razor</h1>
      <p className="leading-8">
        <h2 className='font-semibold'>1.       Your safety razor does exactly what it says</h2>
        There’s a reason we call it a safety razor. If men can use an eco-friendly razor on their face without peril, then that speaks volumes about the safety of this type of razor! We recommend that women get the hang of this eco-friendly razor by shaving the legs first. Once you’ve mastered the legs, you can progress to more challenging areas. Knees, underarms, bikini line – the unisex safety razor can be used in all locations. If you’re nervous the first time, shave whilst soaking in the tub or sit down in the shower for more stability.

        <h2 className='font-semibold'>2.       Anyone can adopt the new technique</h2>
        Many women are concerned that safety razors are more likely to result in a few knicks and cuts. This is one of the most common fears due to the sharpness of the blades. But, you’re far less likely to implement any damage with a sharp safety blade than with a blunt disposable cartridge. All you need to do is remember that safety razors require a different technique, which is easy to master. Always hold the razor at 45 degrees to your skin and take it slowly. There’s no need to apply too much pressure.

        <h2 className='font-semibold'>3.       Safety razors are suitable for sensitive skin</h2>
        Some dermatologists believe that a double-edged safety razor is less likely to cause skin irritation than alternative multi-blade razors. That’s because a series of three, four or five blades are dragging across the skin in one swoop. Safety razors are less likely to cause ingrown hairs too. So if you are prone to these or have sensitive skin, a safety razor might save you a lot of bother. Using a high-quality shaving soap bar will also help to reduce irritation whilst shaving. It is possible to shave without shaving soap, but we wouldn't recommend it!

        <h2 className='font-semibold'>4.       You’ll get the closest shave</h2>
        As well as less irritation, safety razors also enable a far closer shave - which means a superior, silky finish. This is thanks to that sharp blade that you’re biting your nails over. A safety razor results in far less drag on the skin and much less bulk building up between the blades.

        <h2 className='font-semibold'>5.       Your safety razor is environmentally-friendly</h2>
        Seeing as you’ve ended up on the Jungle Culture website, it’s very likely that you’re here looking for ways to go zero-waste. Good news - swapping your disposable razor for a reusable safety razor is one of the best ways to make your lifestyle more sustainable. Plastic razors are as much a culprit as single-use plastic straws when it comes to plastic pollution. After a handful of uses, they are tossed into landfill, and it’s estimated that billions of razor are discarded each year. Meanwhile, the Jungle Culture safety razor for women will last for years. All you need to do is replace the blades - and in most cases the blades can be recycled.

        <h2 className='font-semibold'>6.       And it’s cost-effective!</h2>
        Once you’ve invested in your razor, it should last you a lifetime. You can purchase a safety razor for as little as £16.99 ($20) and a pack of 10 blades will cost you £3.99 ($5). How long you can use each blade varies from person to person, but you should expect between 8 and 16 shaves per blade. Tot up how much you are currently spending on disposable razors and cartridges each month. You’ll be amazed by how much you could save!

        <h2 className='font-semibold'>7.        Pair your safety razor with our organic shaving soap</h2>
        Jungle Culture works with artisan soap makers in Vietnam to produce a range of organic and plastic-free shaving soap bars. We have created shaving soap bars in two luxurious scents: Soothing aloe vera and mint + Charcoal and cracked black pepper. (Update: We've also released a great new range of natural body soaps too!)

      <h1 className="font-semibold text-lg sm:text-2xl">How to become an eco-friendly influencer</h1>
      <p className="leading-8">
        We’ve all heard of influencers. Everyone knows that this phenomenal movement has transformed the way we interact with social media and make lifestyle choices. But, what are influencers exactly? <br />

        And what do influencers doon a daily basis? How do they make a living? And, most importantly to us eco folk, how can being an influencer can help the planet? <br />

        It’s hard to go on Instagram without wondering how influencers work, and in turn - how you can become one yourself! As a zero-waste company, we are keen to hear from more eco-friendly influencers. At the same time, we want to give any aspiring influencers a hand in getting started on your journey to become an eco influencer. For that reason, we’ve prepared a handy guide that tells you all you need to know. <br />

      <h1 className="font-semibold text-lg sm:text-2xl">How do influencers earn money?</h1>
      <p className="leading-8">
        Influencers earn money by partnering with brands within their sphere of expertise and influence. You’ll find travel influencers partnering up with tour agencies, hotels and travel gear companies. Meanwhile, fitness influencers team up with gyms, promote new exercise trends, and may be sponsored by a sportswear brand. And over here in the eco domain, influencers partner with eco-friendly brands. This may be zero-waste fashion, organic food brands, or sustainable products - such as ourselves at Jungle Culture. <br />

        The brand and the influencer negotiate a partnership, whereby the influencer creates content that promotes their product. Influencers earn money from this post, which is ‘sponsored’ by the brand. There’s no set salary for an influencer. What an influencer earns will depend on the budget of the brand(s) they partner with, and how many followers they have. <br />

        In addition to the number of followers, brands prefer to work with influencers whose followers are active. <br />

        As we say, the payment rates fluctuate. A new influencer with less than 10,000 followers may not necessarily receive monetary payment. It’s more likely that they will receive complementary goods and other freebies in exchange for content. Once an influencer hits the sweet spot of around 10,000 followers, they may be able to earn between £50 - £150 per post. A veteran influencer with 100,000+ followers can make several hundred pounds for each piece of content they curate. <br />

        How can being an influencer help the planet? <br />
        So exactly how can being an influencer help the planet? Well, once you’ve built up a following who you have a great relationship with, you’ll find that your followers have genuine appreciation for what you say. They’ll listen to your advice, and aspire to follow in your footsteps. <br />

        Just imagine, you can use your voice to help others make the switch to a zero-waste lifestyle! Reviewing organic products, sharing tips on how to be more sustainable - once you’ve got your audience - you can really make a difference. <br />

        If you ever ponder over why influencer marketing works so well, it’s simple. Consumers trust other people over adverts and other traditional forms of marketing. For authenticity, Instagram influencers must declare to their followers when they receive payment for a post. That’s what it means when the caption announces that the post is sponsored, or when the hashtag #ad is applied. But, the post is curated in such a way that we know that the influencer genuinely uses and finds value in the product or service they are promoting. <br />

      <h2 className='font-semibold'>1. Choose your niche</h2>
      We’ve already established that you want to become an eco-friendly influencer! Within the green sector, you might want to specialise on a certain topic. This might be anything from zero-waste travel to natural grooming and beauty products. You can even keep it broad, and establish yourself as a general lifestyle blog.

      Browse other sustainable influencer accounts and get a sense of what style you like and what identity you wish to build for yourself.

      <h2 className='font-semibold'>2. Start an Instagram account</h2>
      You may already be a step ahead of us! If you haven’t already launched an Instagram account now’s the time. You may want to start a blog too. Not all eco-friendly influencers have a blog, many rely purely on social media to conduct their influencer marketing. That’s your call.

      Start to create content about products that you use and love and post this on your channels. You won’t get paid right at the start, you’ll need to get your followers built up first. You need to create your own style for reviewing products and build a bit of a portfolio - consider it a CV for influencers.

      If you’re a budding new eco-influencer, you can get 10% off any sustainable products by Jungle Culture using the code ZEROWASTE. Be sure to tag us on Instagram and Facebook and then we can repost your content to our followers.

      <h2 className='font-semibold'>3. Develop a content strategy</h2>
      Ensure that you have a strategy behind your content. Followers respond to regular, consistent updates so you’ll need to create a content schedule. You can use a platform like Hootsuite to do this. Make sure that you research the optimum time to post based on your timezone and your demographic.

      Don’t forget about hashtags - these are your golden ticket to gaining followers. Invest some time researching eco-friendly hashtags.

      <h2 className='font-semibold'>4. Grow your following</h2>
      As you create and share content, you will start to see your followers rise. Follow other sustainable brands, publications and other influences and engage with their content to see an impact on your own statistics. What are influencers doing that you can do better?

      Encourage your followers to engage and chatter amongst themselves. Ask questions in your posts which will inspire your followers to reply. Show that you’re following the news relating to the environment and climate change, and share your thoughts. Always respond to any questions and comments. By engaging, you will get to understand who your demographic is - something that brands you partner with will want to know.

      <h2 className='font-semibold'>5. Approach brands</h2>
      Once you’ve developed a decent following, you can start to reach out on Instagram to eco brands you love. Each brand sets their own terms for what they offer influences. Whilst your following is still in its early stages, brands may offer you complimentary products in exchange for an honest review on your Instagram channel, YouTube or blog. Generally, the sweet spot for generating income with sponsored posts is around the 10,000 followers mark.

      At this point, you should edit your bio to say you are open to collaborations with brands.
