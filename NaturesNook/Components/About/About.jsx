                            Nature&apos;s nook was conceived to remedy the damage a single straw can do to our environment. Currently, <b className='text-black'>500 million plastic straws</b> are discarded each year. Each of those straws can take 200 years to break down, and will still exist as micro particle plastics.
                            <br /><br />Before Nature&apos;s nook came Jungle Straws, which was launched in August 2018 with ethically sourced, reusable drinking straws made from the lungs of the East, bamboo. Every straw is handmade in Northern Vietnam at a family-ran bamboo farm. Now they are the #1 best-selling bamboo straw product on Amazon and Jungle Straws have partnered with the likes of National Geographic, BBC Earth and TOMS.

                            <br /><br />Now, under the Nature&apos;s nook canopy, we produce organic coconut bowls, bamboo cutlery, safety razors, shaving soaps, wooden cups and more. All are made from sustainable materials and innovatively crafted with leading British designers and Asian artisans.
                            <br /><br />As a nomadic business, we straddle East and West. Our Headquarters is in Britain, but we continue to make regular visits to our partner farms, factories and craft workshops in Asia. This way we are able to guarantee fair treatment of

We put as much care into forging a unity with our tribe of partners as we do creating our products.
                            <br /><br />We are still explorers at heart, and the journey of Nature&apos;s nook is as organic as our products. Just like bamboo shoots, our beliefs continue to grow and lead us to harvest new ideas. The thing about adopting a sustainable life is that <b className='text-black'>it&apos;s never too late to begin</b>, so why not start your own journey with us today with that single straw.
